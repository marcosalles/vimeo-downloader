# Vimeo downloader

For now, downloads all albums from user with id `VimeoDownloader::@userId` using access key `VimeoDownloader::@secret`, saving them on `./files/albumName/videoId-quality.mp4`, quality from `VimeoDownloader::@quality` in ['hd', 'sd', 'source'].

Just setup and run `ruby download.rb`
